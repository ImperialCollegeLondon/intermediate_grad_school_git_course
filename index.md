## About the RSE team

Your instructors are part of Imperial's central Research Software Engineering (RSE)
team, whose role is to improve the quality, impact and sustainability of research
software. While most of our work is as hired coders and consultants on research
projects, we also offer a number of free services, including training courses such as
this one and one-to-one code clinics, where you can get advice and support with software
development.

You can find more information about our work and the services we offer [on our website].
