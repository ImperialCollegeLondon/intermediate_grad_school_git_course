\subsection*{Further Help}

This course was developed by the \href{https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/}{Research Computing Service (RCS)}
at Imperial College London, in particular by the Research Software Engineering (RSE)
team.

The RSE team are a part of Imperial ICT combining specialist knowledge in software
engineering with extensive experience in research. The team works with academic groups
on a wide range of projects whilst also organising community events and training (such
as this course) for the benefit of the research community. You can find out more at
\href{https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/service-offering/research-software-engineering/}{the RSE team website}
and \href{https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computational-methods/rse/}{the Imperial Research
Software Community website}.
You can also consult the expertise of the RSE team by \href{https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/service-offering/research-software-engineering/code-surgeries/}{booking a code surgery appointment}.

You may also be interested in attending another course developed by the RSE team titled
\textbf{``Essential Software Engineering for Researchers''} which can be
