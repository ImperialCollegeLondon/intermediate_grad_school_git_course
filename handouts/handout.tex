\begin{bluebox}[title=Things to think when publishing code]
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep\itempad
  \item \textbf{Public or Private?} - What level of visibility should your
    project to have? Open code promotes reproducibility and impact but be sure
    to consider and consult any other contributors
  \item \textbf{README.md} - The `front page' of a repository. GitHub will
    automatically render the markdown in this file nicely
  \item \textbf{Licence} - Tell other people what they can and cannot do with
    your code. The College recommended licence is BSD 2- or 3-clause
  \item \textbf{INSTALL.md} - If your project is complex to setup and install be
    sure to include detailed instructions
  \item \textbf{CITATION.cff} - Show how your project should be cited by others
  \item \textbf{CONTRIBUTING.md} - Tell potential contributors the kind of work
    you're interested in and the process they should follow
  \end{itemize}

\begin{bluebox}[title=Glossary]
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep\itempad
    \item \textbf{Repository/Repo} -- A project that is being managed by Git
    \item \textbf{Commit} -- A set of changes recorded in the history of
      a project
    \item \textbf{Staging Area} -- The location where file changes are recorded to
      prepare for inclusion in a commit
    \item \textbf{Working Tree} -- The visible copy of files in a project that you view
      and edit as usual
    \item \textbf{Branch} -- A label used for a set of commits with a particular
      purpose
    \item \textbf{Merge} -- Combine the changes from another branch (or commit etc.)
      into the current one
    \item \textbf{Merge Conflict} -- A state that occurs when merging automatically
      fails because two sets of changes are incompatible. In this case, the changes must
      be resolved manually.
    \item \textbf{main} -- The default name given to the starting branch of all
      repositories
    \item \textbf{HEAD} -- The current commit that the working tree is based on
    \item \textbf{Local} -- A repository copy stored on the computer where you are
      working
    \item \textbf{Remote} -- A repository copy stored elsewhere, usually a hosting
      service like GitHub
    \item \textbf{origin} -- The default name given to a repository's remote
    \item \textbf{Upstream} -- The remote repository with which a local repository is
      associated
    \item \textbf{Tracking} -- Used to describe a branch in a local repository which is
      matched with a branch in a remote repository
    \item \textbf{Fork} -- A copy of a repository on GitHub that is owned by a different
      GitHub user
    \item \textbf{Origin} -- The default name used by Git for a configured remote
      repository
    \item \textbf{Pull Request (PR)} -- A GitHub feature which requests that changes from a
      fork be incorporated into the original repository
    \item \textbf{Continuous Integration (CI)} -- A software development practice which
      involves running automated checks to ensure code contributions meet certain
      criteria. An example of a CI system is GitHub Actions.
    \item \textbf{Semantic Versioning} -- A versioning scheme where the different
      numbers in a software version (e.g. v1.2.3) have a particular meaning
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{git commit --amend} -- Incorporate further changes into the last commit
    and/or edit the commit message

  \item \textbf{git diff} -- Show in detail the changes made in the working directory
    since the last commit
  \item \textbf{git reset -{}-soft HEAD\^} -- Remove the last commit from the history of
    a repository
  \item \textbf{git revert -{}-no-edit COMMIT\_HASH} -- Create a new commit that undoes
    the changes of the specified commit
  \item \textbf{git branch} -- Report on the existing branches in a repository
  \item \textbf{git branch BRANCH\_NAME} -- Create a new branch
  \item \textbf{git branch -D BRANCH\_NAME} -- Delete a branch (be careful with this one!)
  \item \textbf{git checkout} -- Update the position of HEAD to a new branch or commit
  \item \textbf{git merge -{}-no-edit BRANCH\_NAME} -- Merge BRANCH\_NAME into the
    current branch
  \item \textbf{git rebase NEW\_BASE} -- Rebase current branch onto NEW\_BASE
  \item \textbf{git remote add origin REPOSITORY\_URL} -- Configure a local repository
    with a remote with the label 'origin'
  \item \textbf{git push} -- Synchronise changes in the current local branch to its
    upstream branch
  \item \textbf{git push --tags} -- As above, but also push any tags you've created to
    the remote
  \item \textbf{git pull} -- Synchronise changes in the upstream branch to the current
    local one
  \item \textbf{git clone REPOSITORY\_URL} -- Create a new local repository that is a
    copy of remote one
  \item \textbf{git tag TAG\_NAME [COMMIT\_HASH]} -- Create a new tag at the specified
    commit (or at HEAD, if not specified)
