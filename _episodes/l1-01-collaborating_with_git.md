## Working in a Team

### Differing Goals and Objectives

Developer 1 - "I need a new type of analysis to finish my thesis"

Developer 2 - "My problem is bigger. I need better performance to process all my
data"

Even when working independently you might find you need to need to work on
different things at different times. This is greatly compounded however when you
have multiple developers all wanting to contribute to the same Git repository.

Today we will see how Git allows you to have multiple simultaneous streams of
work via **branching and merging**. You can use branches to organise your
individual work and as a way to ensure your Git history doesn't clash with other
contributors.

### Need to Coordinate Efforts

Developer 1 - "I'm still waiting on those changes to the data analysis workflow."

Developer 2 - "Huh? I added those a month ago."

TODO

### Access and Permissions

Developer 1 - "You can put your changes here."

Developer 2 - "It says permission denied :-("

TODO

### Individual styles and preferences

Developer 1 - "Tabs!"

Developer 2 - "Spaces!"

Developer 1 - "TABS!"

Developer 2 - "SPACES!"

TODO

### Different Levels of Experience

Developer 1 - "Here's what I've been working on for the last month."

Developer 2 - "Why didn't you do it this way? It would have been much easier."
