## Overview

This course builds on the [Introduction to using Git and GitHub for software
development] course. While it is not a requirement to have completed the introductory
course, basic familiarity with using Git from the command line is assumed. (Don't worry
if you're rusty!) You should also have a copy of the `recipe` repository locally. If
not, please refer to [the setup instructions].

This course introduces some of the intermediate-level functionality of Git and GitHub.
In addition to providing you with a more thorough understanding of Git and how to use it
to improve your workflow, we will teach about the features of Git and GitHub that allow
you to effectively collaborate with others.

## Learning outcomes

After completing this workshop, you should be able to:

- Use Git branches to manage parallel development of multiple features
- Rewrite your Git history, by undoing changes and rebasing your work onto another
   branch
- Push to and pull from a remote repository
- Create a fork of a repository on GitHub
- Create a pull request (PR) from within the same repo or a fork, request a review and
   respond to reviewer comments
- Provide a helpful code review to others
- Use GitHub Actions as a Continuous Integration (CI) system to ensure contributed code
   meets agreed standards
- Understand semantic versioning
- Create a new tag with Git and push it to a remote
- Create a new release of your software on GitHub

## Delivery of the course

Material will be delivered as a lecture with task following the Carpentries teaching
style.

- The instructor will walk you through the theoretical material of the course,
  demonstrating the execution of the relevant code and instructions. **You are highly
  encouraged to code along** and execute the instructions at the same time.
- Throughout the lessons, there are **yellow boxes** highlighting particularly
  challenging or important concepts.
- There are also exercises in **orange boxes**. The instructor will give you time to try
  to do them yourself before going through the solution. This is often available in a
  folded part of the orange box, so you can check it at any time.
- When doing exercises, put a green sticker in your computer whenever you are done, or a
  pink/orange one if you need support. A helper will go to you.
- For online sessions, raise your hand if you are done with the exercise and write any
  questions or problems directly into the chat, so a helper can try to solve it.
